        <h1> Project Scope: </h1>
        <p>Yoga design lab needed several custom HTML email templates developed to send to their clients world wide. I designed three emails for Yoga Design Lab: Product launch,  Consent email, and an Abandoned cart email to re-target clients. Each template was carefully hand coded with HTML & CSS to be fully responsive on Desktop and mobile devices. All my email templates are meticulously tested across all email clients to ensure each email renders correctly and is optimized for deliverability. Sense this project I have also coded a landing page for Yoga Design Lab with a simple call to action.</p>

           <h1> Project Scope:</h1>
           <p> ABC Medical reached out to me when Nurse Appreciation Week came around. At the time it was the start of the Covid 19 pandemic so this email was very important for all of their nurse clients. After a consultation I got an idea for the type of email they wished to create for their clients. I hand  coded this email with HTML and CSS to have bulletproof rendering across all email clients. I used media queries to ensure the design was fully responsive for all devices. The fun part was adapting the email to be deployed in outlook 2013. Of course the newsletter was tested across all email clients to render correctly and have optimal deliverability.  The email template had a success full deployment with satisfactory results. </p>
